inference. This programming language has the following features:

  * lambda-expressions
  * namespaces as modules
  * type system
  * type inference
  * kind system 
  * kind inference
  * polymorphic types as type functions
  * recursive types
  * type conjunction and type disjunction
  * curried type functions
  * lambda-expressions
  * parameter kinds
  * ad-hoc polymorphism
